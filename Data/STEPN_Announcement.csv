**BANNABLE OFFENSES** 
These are offenses on top of the existing points outlined in #🚨︱-rules . 

1. Insults, cuss words, Racial slurs, verbal abuse and any forms of verbal harassment towards any other member in the StepN Server, **even when written in a different language**, will get you **BANNED**. 
2. If you have issues with invitations or invitation count, please post it in #deleted-channel . Anyone who asks about invites in #💬︱-general will be **muted for 2 hours**. Repeat offenders will be **BANNED**. 
3. Anyone who performs a `-checkinvite` or `-invite` in any channel OUTSIDE of #❓︱-checkinvite-hide will be **BANNED**. 
4. Spamming in any channel where there are clear instructions not to spam will be **BANNED**. 

**REMINDERS:** 
1. If your invite link is `https: //discord.gg/stepn` instead of a personalized link like `https: //discord.gg/abVpUkxC`, that means the server has run out of personalized links. Our team deletes expired links at regular intervals, hence please try generating another personalized link after a couple of hours. 

2. Since NFT distribution is a manual process, plesae be advised that awarding your NFT will take some time. We cannot provide an ETA as to when they will be available in your wallet; all we can promise you is that if you were entitled to an NFT, **you will receive it, even if it takes a while to deliver it to you**. We appreciate your patience. 

3. Rules and tips are always pinned, so **always check the PINNED MESSAGES in all of the channels.** Ignoring pinned messages is not an excuse for not knowing the rules/tips. If you spam in a channel where there is a pinned message that says ""Spam here and you will be banned"", you will be banned, even if you never read the pinned messages. 

4. **READ ANNOUNCEMENTS**. Not knowing the recent announcements will not absolve you if  you commit the mistakes that **WE WARNED YOU ABOUT IN ANNOUNCEMENTS**. Announcements exist for a reason.","","🔥 (1),👍 (1)"

Thanks to everyone who participated in STEPN’s invitation contest. The special airdrops rewards have been transferred to qualified invitation contest winners. Any Shoebox fails to transfer to the STEPN game before 22nd will be invalid and no longer be able to open.

For those who have successfully invited over 30 but less than 100 verified members, you will be rewarded a Shoebox with a random number between #3000 and #4999.
For those who have successfully  invited over 100 verified members, you will only receive one Shoebox with a random number between #1000 and #2999.

If you did not receive the special NFT Shoebox by now, You might have been disqualified from the contest. We have manually checked all the entries and have spotted a few members inviting ghost accounts into our server. STEPN does not tolerate such acts and we have disqualified those members to ensure the fairness among all participants. If you believe you are disqualified by mistake, please get a support ticket and provide us with your evidence

Hello everyone. 

We understand that several members lost their `olympic runner`/`blade runner` role today. 
This is due to us re-validating invites performed by everyone in the server. This recounted the number of invites, resulting in some people losing their roles due to the following: 

1. Your invitees did join the server, but didn't get past the verification. 
2. Your invitees left the server. 
3. Your invitees have been banned/kicked. 
4. Our validation process has detected that your invites are invalid based on internal metrics (even if the members met the 3 requirements above).

We have two separate steps for the invitation process: 
1. A bot counter counts your invitees in #❓︱-checkinvite-hide , who shows you which invitees meet criteria 1 to 3. 
2. A validator, which uses specific metrics to separate real humans from bots/alts/ghost accounts.

**This means that:**
 
1. Even if the **invite counter** says you have 105 invites, the **validator** may consider all 105 invalid, hence not granting or even taking away your role. 
2. Unfortunately, the validator will also invalidate real human invitees, if they act like alts/ghost/bot accounts. 

We apologize for the inconvenience, and we appreciate your understanding. 
If you have issues with your roles, please raise a ticket in #deleted-channel , however due to us being undrestaffed, we may get back to you in 24-48 hours.

In the latest AMA session (26th December 2021), our team mentioned that the current energy in STEPN is oversupplied to encourage players to experience the game. 
Now that we've had a week of free energy, We have set the energy rate to the standard level, with the following energy gain per sneakers owned (see chart): 

**NOTES:** 
Having Green (uncommon) sneakers will add +1 energy to your base energy.
Having Blue (rare) sneakers will add +2 energy to your base energy.

**EXAMPLE 1:** 1 green shoe + 1 normal shoe -->  2base (+1green) = 3 energy total
**EXAMPLE 2:** 1 green, + 1 blue + 1 normal --> 4base (+2blue+1green) = 7 energy total

We acknowledge that these changes should have been announced ahead of time. We apologize for this lapse at our end, and would like to ask for your consideration. 🙏🏾 
Your trust is important to us, hence moving forward we will ensure open communication with the community before implementing major changes in the app.

App development
A lot of mini update for this week, including the readjustment to the sneaker number vs. energy; GPS improvement; wallet user experience improvement:
We implement the diminishing return on energy vs. sneakers in inventory;
We further optimized the issue with GPS accuracy
We optimized the wallet backup function

Going forward, we have big plan for next week:
Swap function is in internal testing and will be in our next major patch update
We re-worked the wallet so that the transaction waiting time between vault and wallet is reduced (we have implemented several fixes to this and reduce the time from 1 hr to couple mins, we aims to achieve near-instant transaction in the next couple patches)
We re-work the interface of the wallet and vault to make it more intuitive
We are making good progress on the marketplace and will start internal testing in the next couple weeks.

However, we have found an issue that needed a critical fix, and we wanted the fix deployed first before granting access to the STEPN app again, especially to new players. 
That deployment is in 48 hours, hence we will start distributing activation codes again after said 48 hours.

Hello @everyone ! 

As you all probably know by now, our utility token (GST) and our sneaker prices in Magic Eden are both doing exceedingly well. Just like you, we are very much elated at this development, as these high values indicate a strong belief and confidence in our project, and for that we want to thank everyone!!  

Being a new project, we are still very much in our price exploration stage. We therefore think it's best to temper this enthusiasm with a gentle reminder that **markets can be volatile.** Purchasing GST or NFTs (Sneakers, Shoeboxes) at high valuation can lead to losses if the values suddenly stop growing or even fall in prices. GST is subject to inflation and has infinite supply, and NFTs can also increase at our discretion as the STEPN app gains traction. Please exercise responsibility and due diligence before you partake in the purchase of GST or NFTs. 

**With our very strong momentum barely a week into 2022, we hope to continue stepping forward with all of you!** :partysneaker::partysneaker::partysneaker:","","👟 (1),partysneaker (1),coolsneaker (1),__ (1)"

Hello @everyone . 

We will now be manually granting Activation Codes ONLY to members who bought sneakers from Magic Eden. 

If you need an activation code, please message @GilNextDoor or @Spirit with the following: 
1. A screenshot showing your sneaker,  with the wallet address visible in the screenshot. 
2. The transaction link proving that the sneaker was purchased at around the market price (e.g. proving it was not gifted). 

We may not respond immediately (e.g. the message was received at 2 AM at our timezone), but even so, rest assured we are going to respond to you as soon as we are available.

If you didn't purchase a sneaker from Magic Eden, please wait for the app update tomorrow (12 hours from now) to use the in-game activation code issuance feature instead, as discussed in the AMA.

Please be advised that **ROUND 1** for the **Paper Hands, Diamond Hands,** and **Showrunner Contests** will end tonight, January 24, 2022 11:59 PM Sydney time. 

Please be reminded of the rules for all three contests: 

⚠️ Contest participants must be active in Discord in the past 7 days, have a STEPN NFT sneaker with over 20 km running/walking distance in the STEPN app, and at least one level 5 sneaker at the time of winning. 
⚠️ You can only win ONE NFT and ONE ROLE from these three contests. You can keep joining any contest until  you win one of them!
⚠️ You may submit as many entries as you want, but your FIRST entry is your ONLY entry for that round! Submitting more entries will NOT increase your chances of winning!
⚠️Tagging the STEPN Team or any of the admins in your entries, whether inside or outside the submission channels, will result in you being muted for 24 hours!
🚫 Plagiarized and even partially plagiarized entries will result in an **IRREVOCABLE BAN!**

**If after being declared a winner we see that you do NOT meet any of the above requirements, your win will be forfeited and given to the next eligible contestant.** 

For example, we require an account that has been active in Discord for the past 7 days. Being active in the past 6 days only, or past 5 days, or past 4 days only etc. will NOT count, and will disqualify your win.

"372422575818539029","GilNextDoor#1263","29-Jan-22 05:29 PM","**PATCH UPDATE NOTES** 

Hello @everyone . 

We have received community feedback regarding discrepancies between the app and the whitepaper. These discrepancies were due to changes that needed to be done, sometimes within very short time windows, and often with little opportunity for communication. We apologize that some of these changes could not be announced ahead of time, but rest assured that we remain committed to our goal of keeping the game’s sustainability and balance at the forefront. 

Below are the changes we have applied to our newest update, which will also be reflected in our whitepaper page and Update Google doc in our Linktree. Unless otherwise specified, **changes in this update will be reflected in the Whitepaper within the next 48 hours.**

:partysneaker: **SYSTEM AND DOCUMENTATION CHANGES: ** :partysneaker: 

🔹 **DROP RATE OF UNCOMMON SNEAKERS FROM COMMON SHOEBOXES.** Based on our data modeling, a 10% drop rate for Uncommon sneakers is too high and will quickly devalue Common sneakers if kept at such a rate. We therefore changed the drop rate of Uncommons from 10% to 5%. Seeing as this will also become an issue for other Shoebox qualities if left unchanged, we also updated the drop rates for all Shoebox qualities as shown below.  We will start looking into the minting cost modelling next and adjust the figure accordingly.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/907818005902295120/936915977436815360/unknown.png","🇯🇵 (2)"
"372422575818539029","GilNextDoor#1263","29-Jan-22 05:29 PM","🔹**REWORK OF SHOEBOX DROP RATIO**. We have also updated the Shoebox drop ratio to accurate values, see below:","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/907818005902295120/936916070202220614/unknown.png","🇷🇺 (2),👍 (3)"
"372422575818539029","GilNextDoor#1263","29-Jan-22 05:31 PM","🔹 **MIN-MAX VALUES PER SNEAKER QUALITY.** The attribute ranges specified in the whitepaper are not reflective of the actual min-max values of Sneakers. We will update our documentation to reflect the current (and accurate) min-max values for each sneaker quality. See below:","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/907818005902295120/936916334325940244/unknown.png","👍 (4),🇷🇺 (2),⬅️ (1),💩 (1)"
"372422575818539029","GilNextDoor#1263","29-Jan-22 05:32 PM","🔹 **LUCK VALUE AND LOOT BOXES/MYSTERY BOXES.** (To be implemented in the next week). After intensive testing by our development team, we ascertained that the luck attribute and loot drop box rates had to undergo major reworking. Consequently, we took it offline and reworked it. We are now fairly confident with the new configuration, which will be in effect next update. New Luck values and mechanisms which will also be reflected in the whitepaper.  

🔹 **MORE STAT POINTS FOR HIGHER QUALITY SNEAKERS.** (To be implemented in the next 48 hours). We feel that the difference in stats between sneaker qualities are currently too small to be noticeable (i.e. there’s just a few points of difference in minimum/maximum stats between COMMON and UNCOMMON sneakers). To widen the gap (and add more value to better quality sneakers), we are now adding more points per level up for higher quality sneakers, as shown below. (For owners who have already levelled up their higher-quality sneakers, once these changes are implemented you should see surplus points in your sneaker's profile which you can then distribute to your sneaker attributes.)","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/907818005902295120/936916597547892746/unknown.png","👀 (45),🎉 (17),__ (2),👍 (3),🇷🇺 (3)"
"372422575818539029","GilNextDoor#1263","29-Jan-22 05:33 PM",":partysneaker: **SYSTEM ISSUES**:partysneaker: 

🔸 **CURRENCY SWAP ISSUES (FIXED).** Our team is aware that people have experienced failed trades between SOL and GST/USDC. These failures were traced to Orca routing issues, which was patched just today. This has been fixed at our end as well.
🔸 **TRANSFER ISSUES TO/FROM STEPN AND EXTERNAL WALLET, OR TO/FROM STEPN WALLET TO/FROM STEN VAULT (FIXED).** The issues were due to the Solana congestion that occurred earlier this week. However, members believed that if a transaction showed up as complete in Solscan, then it was no longer a Solana problem but a STEPN problem. As Solana congestions may happen again, it's important to explain that some third-party nodes may work fine even while Solana's RPC node (the node STEPN uses) is still suffering from congestion. It is therefore possible for transactions to appear completed in Solscan yet remain unprocessed at STEPN's end. However, to minimize the impact on STEPN whenever Solana encounters issues like this, we are in the process of changing our node (which will require a revamp of the whole wallet system). 
🔸 **GPS/SPEED INACCURACY ISSUES (CONTINUOUS FIXING).** With the help of player feedback, our team has identified the source of the GPS/speed issue. Though we have applied an immediate hotfix, please note that resolving this will be a continuous effort of trial and error to get GPS and speed as close as possible to 100% accuracy. Your continued feedback will help us reach our goal of creating an accurate, reliable fitness app.

🆕 **Improved Home page:** There is now a replenish timer for the Energy bar
🆕 **Improved Wallet:** We have enhanced the transaction speed between Spending account and Wallet
🆕 **In-app tutorial:** We have enhanced the user onboarding experience by adding an in-app guide on how to use STEPN

:partysneaker: **NEW EVENT** :partysneaker: 
We will roll out a double energy week sometime within February. During the event, all energy will be doubled (capped at 20/20 energy). If you have a surplus of energy (due to a surplus of sneakers), we recommend sharing the STEPN experience to friends and family by letting them borrow your sneakers. Stay tuned for the announcement of the event details! 

:partysneaker: **CLOSING THOUGHTS** :partysneaker: 

We thank everyone who has journeyed with us so far, from the newest elite runners to the most veteran season 1 club members. We are working tirelessly to deliver the best product and user experience we can provide to all of you. There are so many things we want to build, and it is your feedback and support that will help us shape this app to scale it for millions and beyond. As developers, we will not stop to create values to our users, and in the future, GMT holders. 

Once again, thank you.

We'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who provided us valuable feedback regarding GPS inaccuracies in the past several days. With your contribution, we are happy to announce that we will be releasing a redesigned algorithm in the next major update, as part of our ongoing GPS improvement. Hopefully this enhancement will provide an improved user experience to everyone! 

On top of this fix, we will also re-calibrate the earning rate per sneaker type, and these earning rates will be aligned with the base returns cited in our Whitepaper as well. 

As part of the gamified experience, an additional randomizer will also be added so that no two runs, no two walks, no two journeys will yield the same earning.

Your continued support, feedback, and encouragement helps us stay on course during this Beta Access stage, and for all of that we are truly grateful. If you have any advice or suggestions, please continue sharing your experiences with us via the in-app feedback function. 

We are committed in optimizing STEPN, one step at a time, until the STEPN app is as balanced and sustainable as we envisioned it to be.

> 🔹Players can play the daily quiz an unlimited number of times until they win the master of the day role. 
> 🔹Once a player has earned the master of day role, s/he can no longer win either the hourly or daily quiz, as the bot will ignore  master of day holders during the winner selection.

Hello @everyone , 

We would like to clarify concerns regarding Galaxy's STEPN collaboration: https://galaxy.eco/StepN/campaign/GCqVXUUpEr/. 
**Note that this event has already ended after STEPN sent the whitelist snapshot on February 25.**

For this campaign, users needed to complete 27 tasks on the Galaxy platform. For the STEPN task, users are required to buy a sneaker and move to earn to get $50. 

Once all tasks are completed, the player can then collect a meta NFT from Galaxy. (NOTE: Only new users who registered STEPN account during the Galaxy event are eligible.) 

According to Galaxy's rules, the last snapshot for STEPN should have been taken on February 24, 2022. This 'snapshot' refers to the list of users who have accomplished the required tasks above. However, STEPN actually sent the whitelist only last night, February 25. This should have technically given players more time to complete the STEPN portion of the tasks. 

**At this time, we can no longer add players to the already-submitted whitelist.** 

For those who completed the STEPN portion of the tasks, STEPN will award the $50 additional reward in the next couple of weeks, latest March 14, 2022. We will update here once all additional rewards have been distributed.

Hello @everyone . 

Since the announcement of the STEPN (GMT) Token Sale on Binance Launchpad, we have received dozens of reports from users claiming that they were entitled to an NFT from several months past. 

Our team has already distributed all the Rewards we owe our members for the year 2021, and we currently lack the manpower to revisit old records to verify prize distribution from half a year ago. We are therefore introducing a rule where, once you have been announced as a winner for any Discord/Twitter contest, you have 7+30 days to claim your prize (7 days processing time + 30 days claiming time). 

**Once 7+ 30 days has passed from the winner announcement and you have not claimed your prize, the prize is considered forfeited.**

Hello @everyone . 

A gentle reminder to everyone to be careful with purchasing decisions made while STEPN is still in its Early Access phase. It is a stage when in-game mechanics are still being worked out. If you purchase Sneakers, Shoeboxes, Gems, or GST based on how things are working NOW, it may not pay off when things work differently LATER.

**And as with any cryptocurrency, prices can be very, very volatile at such an early stage and there is equal chance of great gains and great losses. **

‼️ **Please do not invest money in crypto that you cannot afford to lose.** ‼️

Hello @everyone . As requested, here's the shortened versions of our two biggest news for this week! 

🪙 🪙 🪙  **The STEPN (GMT) Token Sale on Binance Launchpad -- DIGESTED!!!** 🪙 🪙 🪙 

1. Make sure you have BNB tokens in your Binance account starting March 2, 2022, 12:00 AM UTC until March 8, 2022 11:59 PM UTC. That's it, just hold it and do nothing. 
2. For those 7 days, Binance will take the daily average amount of BNB you're holding. 
3. At the end of those 7 days, whatever average amount you have for those 7 days, that's the MAXIMUM BNB amount you can use to buy GMT with on step 4.  
4. MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWAKE on March 9, 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM UTC, because everyone has ONLY 3 HOURS to subscribe and get a Token Purchase Agreement from Binance. Once you subscribe, your BNB will be LOCKED until STEP 6 HAPPENS. 
5. On the same day, March 9, 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM UTC, Binance will calculate the distribution of GMT to each subscriber. 
6. On the same day, March 9, 10:00 AM, BNB will be deducted from your account. Your GMT (and any leftover BNB) will be transferred to your Binance Spot Wallet. 

🏃🏾 🏃🏾 🏃🏾  **The STEPN TRAILBLAZER EVENT -- DIGESTED!!!** 🏃🏾 🏃🏾 🏃🏾 

1. TRAILBLAZERS are people who have had AT LEAST ONE SHOE and have been using AT LEAST 2 ENERGY from 20th Dec 2021 to 23rd Feb, 2022 2:00 AM, Sydney time. 
2. STEPN will give you tickets based on the amount of DAILY ENERGY you have spent within those two months. 

**LESS THAN 2 ENERGY DAILY:** 0 tickets. 
**≥ 2 to <4 ENERGY DAILY: **2 tickets per Energy consumed.
**≥ 4 to <9 ENERGY DAILY:** 4 tickets per Energy consumed.
**≥9 to <12 ENERGY DAILY:** 6 tickets per Energy consumed.
**≥12 to <20 ENERGY DAILY:** 8 tickets per Energy consumed.
**20 ENERGY DAILY:** 10 tickets per Energy consumed.

3. **Did you get a total of 50 tickets in those two months?** GREAT! You will be qualified to an exclusive 48 hours Triple Earning Event! 
4. **Did you get a total of 200 tickets in those two months?** EVEN BETTER! You will be qualified to both an exclusive 48 hours Triple Earning Event, AND you will also qualify for a Special GMT Airdrop!... 🔹

🔹 ...That is, assuming you're not from these countries: Belarus, People's Republic of China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, United States of America and its territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), Zimbabwe.) 

5. We will announce when we are about to release the tally of tickets for everyone, and the date for the Triple Earning event. **STAY TUNED! **

Hello @everyone;  

As everyone knows, **GST has reached a new ATH (All Time High) price of USD$4.00 today.** 

Though this is certainly very good news to our current player base, we again feel the need to remind everyone to **PLEASE be very careful with purchasing decisions made at this time.** 

GST is a utility token, and due to its currently limited supply, its price can fluctuate VERY FAST. We don't want anyone hoarding bags of GST, hoping the prices will rise even higher, only to be disappointed when the price eventually gets corrected later on. 

Please also bear in mind that STEPN is still in its EARLY ACCESS phase. **Prices can be very, very volatile at such an early stage in any project, and there is equal chance of making great gains and great losses.**

Hello @everyone;  

We are aware that **GMT has reached a new ATH (All Time High) of $0.1962, an increase of 87% in the past 24 hours.** 

We are happy for those who believe in the potential of our project and have invested in our governance token, as this is undoubtedly very good news for GMT's early investors. However, in good conscience we have to remind everyone yet again to **PLEASE be very careful with your token purchases, whether GMT or GST.**

GMT is available for purchase to everyone, including speculators, which means even people who don't play STEPN can buy GMT for no other reason than to profit from it. There will be traders who will hoard GMT quickly and dump GMT just as quickly, as they have zero incentive to keep the token (i.e. they do not play the game).

As GMT is barely two days old, please note that **GMT prices can be very, very volatile, and there is equal chance of making great gains and great losses.**

:walletv2: **Spending account and Wallet Upgrade Plan Changes** :walletv2:

In our Medium article (https://stepnofficial.medium.com/stepn-decentralized-wallet-and-marketplace-upgrade-plan-e330b1cb4db4) outlining the wallet upgrade, we divided the tasks we needed to complete into two stages: 

1. Unify the Spending account and STEPN Wallet, removing the Spending account altogether (1st Mar — 1st April/May). 
2. Multi-chain Wallet Upgrade that will allow token trading, staking, and unstaking (1st April — 1st May/June). 

However, based on our latest work assessment, it would make for a much smoother transition if we did both stages at the same time. 

Therefore, **both changes will be executed around the original timeframe for the wallet upgrade (should be completed by 1st May/June)**. This means that we are NOT removing the SPENDING wallet this March.

Hello @everyone ! 

Previously, we allowed private trades in the STEPN server without any consequences. (A private trade is when a sneaker seller and a potential sneaker buyer agree to buy/sell outside of Magic Eden/STEPN in-app, to avoid trading fees.) We allowed this simply because we expected members to **have done their own research and are aware of the risks involved with private trading**. 

However, there has been a growing number of scammed victims due to private trades, and by the time we receive their complaint it's often too late-- the buyer has already sent their payment, and the seller's sneaker is **NOWHERE TO BE SEEN**. 

**We will now put a stop to this to protect our members.** 

⚠️ The moment we see you saying ""DM me to trade"" or anything similar IN ANY CHANNEL, we will **BAN YOU**. 
⚠️ If anyone reports to us that you are DMing them to trade, we will **BAN YOU**. 
#🚀︱-nft-marketplace will now only be used to raise ""looking for sneaker"" questions or shill sneaker/s that are currently available for sale in Magic Eden/in-app marketplace.

Hello @everyone! 

For ""Wallet binding failed"" issue, below is the suggested workaround for the moment: 

**NEW USERS:** During wallet creation, at the very last stage you will be asked to put in your seed phrase, and this is where it fails. Instead of verifying the seed phrases at the last stage, EXIT the process. Then in the wallet section,  go to the gear at the upper right corner  > choose to restore wallet > input the seed phrases that was given to you at the beginning part of wallet creation. Make sure to put your seed phrases in the right order. Then you will be able to create a new wallet.

**OLD USERS:** Once you're logged into the app, go to the wallet section > go to the gear at the upper right corner  > choose to restore wallet > input the seed phrases of your old wallet. Make sure to put your seed phrases in the right order. you should be able to restore your old wallet.

Hello @everyone! 

We would like to share the following updates: 

✅ **Wallet binding failed.** This issue is now resolved.
✅ **Old existing accounts being asked to login with email/code AND activation code** To resolve this, please proceed with logging in with your existing credentials (with email address/code), and get your activation code at #②︱-activation-code. This should resolve your issue.
✅ **Old existing accounts getting an error that their email address is invalid.** Please ensure that there is **NO SPACE** at the very end of your email address. Otherwise, close the app, shut down your phone for 30 seconds, then reopen the phone/app. This should resolve your issue.
✅ **Network issues when logging in, or while running.** This issue is now resolved.

If the app says you are moonwalking, that means the route/situation/activity you are doing is not supposed to earn GST, even if that used to give you GST in the past. 

In the meantime, we are still working on: 

🇽 **Old existing accounts logging in and seeing a different wallet connected to their account.** When they try to use their existing wallet seedphrase, they get an error saying ""wallet already exists"". We will update here as soon as this matter is resolved. 

We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused, and thank you for your patience. Rest assured our team is working on resolving these issues as soon as possible.

Hello @everyone! 

When we create tickets for your concerns here in Discord, we may sometimes ask for screenshots of the errors you are experiencing. However, **please do not share any screenshot of your WALLET SEED PHRASE in any ticket, in any location in Discord, or in any other social media platform (Telegram, Reddit, Facebook, etc.)** 

If the error we are troubleshooting with you is happening in the wallet seed phrase window itself, you can simply refuse our screenshot request and say that it will show your seed phrase. The moderator team will understand. Even if Support tickets are private and are only visible to Moderator Team members, **your wallet seed phrase is the key to your wallet and nobody else should know it except you.**

This error is due to Cloudflare failing to connect via wifi in certain locations, most likely due to an unstable network. However, this is not an app issue, as majority of our users are able to connect to STEPN without problems.

If you are getting the handshake error yourself, please try **changing your connection** (e.g. from wifi to mobile data/4g). 

You may also **try using a VPN to connect**, which seems to resolve this issue in nearly all cases.

Hello @everyone ! 

Here is a more in-depth explanation of the changes that were performed during the 16th March update (https://discord.com/channels/890163015561932840/907818005902295120/953601300908617779): 

🔹 **Using devices that have been jailbroken, rooted, or with an altered OS will result in STEPN not working properly.** We have implemented a change where you will be constantly and consistently moonwalking if you use STEPN in a jailbroken/rooted/altered device. This is to prevent STEPN from being installed in devices where it can be exploited using unauthorized tools. 

🔹 **If you lose energy because you transferred a sneaker from Inventory to the STEPN WALLET, you will LOSE ALL YOUR UNOPENED MYSTERY BOXES.** This is to address an exploit where players were passing around sneakers across multiple accounts to open mystery boxes without having to use GST.

*Note that losing energy by listing a sneaker in the marketplace will NOT purge mystery boxes.

👟 **SCENARIO 1:** 
You have 3 common sneakers, therefore you have 4 energy.
You then transferred one sneaker from Inventory to STEPN wallet.
**RESULT:** Your energy will drop from 4 to 2, and all your mystery boxes will be purged.

👟 **SCENARIO 2:** 
You have 12 common sneakers, therefore you have 9 energy.
You transferred one sneaker from Inventory to STEPN wallet.
**RESULT:** Even if your total sneaker count drops from 12 to 11, you will not lose energy, so you will keep your mystery boxes.

👟 **SCENARIO 3:**
You have 1 common sneaker and 1 uncommon or rare sneaker.
You transferred the uncommon/rare sneaker from Inventory to STEPN wallet.
**RESULT:** Uncommon/rare sneakers give bonus energy, so transferring them will make you lose energy no matter how many sneakers you have, and all your mystery boxes will be purged.

Hello @everyone!

Moving forward we are implementing strict rules in the awarding and claiming of prizes for upcoming Contests and Campaigns. 

**SUMMARY:** 

1. If we find out later on that you broke the rules of any contest (whether held in Discord, Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, or any other social media), we reserve the right to remove an awarded NFT; if removing the NFT is impossible, we reserve the right to lock the NFT, ensuring that it yields zero returns to whichever account is holding it. 
2. The standard wait time for prizes is 7 days + 15 days for prize delivery (7 days processing time + 15 days delivery time).
3. The standard claiming time for prizes is 7+30 days (7 days + 15 days for prize delivery + 15 days to claim the prize). Once 7+ 30 days has passed, any unclaimed prizes will be considered forfeited.

Hello @everyone. 

We have received several reports of ""missing"" assets/tokens after transferring them from wallet to wallet, wallet to spending, or spending to wallet. 

Rest assured that your assets are not ""missing"", they're basically caught in traffic and are just waiting for the congestion to ease up. As long as your transaction is recorded in the blockchain, your asset is safe and won't just disappear. 

I have previously advised everyone to wait 24 hours for their transfers to self-solve, and I am aware that a lot of your issues did not self-solve. Delays like this are due to third-party RPC nodes. I'm currently communicating these stuck transactions to the team, to see if there is anything we can do about them. 

Please give us some time to work something out, and we will update you as soon as we have news to share.

🔸 **""I went to #②︱-activation-code and it's saying there are no more codes!""**
🔹 Currently, we have a limit of 1,000 codes issued via #②︱-activation-code channel per day. 

🔸 **""But I need a code! I even have a sneaker already!""** 
🔹 We are gatekeeping the number of people getting into STEPN, so for now you can join only by invitation. 

For now, it's best to find a current STEPN player and see if s/he can provide you an activation code. 
Another alternative is to simply wait in #🎫︱-activation-code-sharing for a kind-hearted member to post a code.  
If you are a current STEPN player and have an activation code to share, you can paste it there too.

🔸**""Someone offered to give me an activation code if I pay money, is that legit?""** 
🔹It doesn't matter if the activation code is legit or not. Do not DM suspicious people with suspicious offers. If someone offers you an Activation Code for money, please report at #scammer-report so we can **BAN THEM**. 

🔸**""I now have an activation code, but I'm not earning GST! What gives?!""** 
🔹 Just having an Activation Code is not enough to start earning GST in STEPN. You need to buy a sneaker to earn in the app.

So, first things first: did you actually EVER use a password when logging into STEPN?

Hello @everyone ! 

We know a lot of you are still waiting for responses for your feedback tickets. 
However, due to how accessible the in-app ""feedback"" button is, there has been thousands of tickets submitted in the past few days (two thousand in the past 2 days alone) for issues that were resolved some few hours later. 

As the Customer Support Team needs to go through tickets on a first-in first-out basis, this means going through hundreds of tickets before getting to the ones that really need help. 

**As part of the Customer Support Streamlining process, we are going to close all tickets that have not yet been answered at this time, including all tickets that will be submitted in the next 2 HOURS.**

This means that if you have submitted a ticket in the past, or submit a ticket in the next 2 hours, they will be closed with a prepared set of instructions that you can try regarding your concern. 

Once the 2 hours is over, please submit your tickets again. We request for the Community to avoid submitting tickets with this content: 

-- Suggestions
-- Requests for Free Sneakers 
-- Questions about gameplay that can be answered in the Whitepaper 
-- Discord-specific concerns or issues
-- Anything that's NOT URGENT, so as to give way to members who have urgent requests.

**Solana is currently experiencing degraded performance.** You can check Solana's status by going to https://status.solana.com/.

Hello @everyone. 

A few reminders about recent developments in the app: 

1. For those receiving the error ""Please revoke listing first, then change the price"" when listing their sneaker at the marketplace, **please remove any gem that might still be in the sneaker.** The system won't allow you to sell sneakers that have gems in them. We will work on correcting the error message to better convey the warning. 

2. Would also like to clarify any rumor about there being a hidden or planned prize for people using up (or inversely, saving up) their activation codes. **The team has no plans to create an event involving usage/sharing of activation codes now, or in the far foreseeable future.** Feel free to give away your codes as you please. 

3. There is now a function in the app to **DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT.** Please note that ANY deletion is irreversible, even if the deletion was done accidentally, done by a friend who borrowed your phone, done out of curiosity, et cetera. If you don't plan to delete your account, **DON'T TRY TO DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT**. 

4. If your assets seem stuck or delayed, please be patient and wait for the assets to simply arrive on their own. We used to advise members to wait for 24 hours, but some have reported getting their assets unstuck after 30 hours, 3 days, or almost a week. Again, we ask that you bear with us and just wait for the issue to self-solve. As long as the transfer/purchase was recorded in the blockchain, your assets are safe.

🔸  **You used an already-used code.** Please ensure that the code has never been used.
🔸  **Your code is mistyped or invalid.** Please double check your activation code and ensure it is correct, e.g. it has no missing digits or extra digits (activation codes are 8 DIGITS ONLY), and all the numbers in it are correct. 
🔸  **You may have stayed on the activation code screen too long.** When this happens, simply close the app and restart the login process.

🔸**Why do transfers cost GST now?!**
🔹STEPN used to pay for the transfer costs in the past, but with the growth in playerbase count we realized it's something we can no longer sustain. 

🔸**Why do I have to pay to open Mystery Boxes now?!**
🔹Previously, Gems were virtually free, but offered very little stat improvement especially at gem level 1 or 2. To change that, we implemented an update where all gems now give bonuses by percentages. The mystery boxes have been updated as well, e.g. now it takes 48 hours less to open an MB. However, the drawback is that all Mystery Boxes now have a base cost that needs to be paid befor the Mystery Box can be opened, regardless if the box is still under timer or not.

We have received reports of people having difficulties trading/swapping tokens via the in-app wallet.

Hello @everyone . 

When purchasing shoeboxes via Binance NFT (https://www.binance.com/en/nft/event/stepn), **please pay attention to the logo on the shoeboxes that you're purchasing.** 

**NOT ALL STEPN NFTS IN BINANCE ARE ASICS-BRANDED.** Some bad actors take advantage of the higher price point for ASICS NFTs by listing regular shoeboxes alongside ASICS ones. You should be able to tell them apart by the logo on the shoeboxes. 

**Always double check and triple check when making purchases, whether in the in-app marketplace or at Binance.** 

Thank you for the heads up, @Ryuster!

Hello @everyone . 

We have received reports of durability loss if the app is left running even after all energy has been consumed. (By design, there should be 0 durability loss when there is 0 energy remaining, even if STEPN is left running.) 

For now, **please STOP your STEPN app once your energy has dropped to zero.** In the meantime, our team will be looking into these reports.
